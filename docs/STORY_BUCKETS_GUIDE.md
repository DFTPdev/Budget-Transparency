## 💳 9. Debt & Reserves

**What it covers:** Debt service, rainy day funds, and financial reserves

### Technical Categories Included:
- **Currently none** - This bucket is reserved for future use

### What This Means:
This bucket is designed to track amendments related to paying off state debt (bonds) and building financial reserves for emergencies. Currently, these items are grouped under "Government & Overhead" but could be split out with more granular data parsing.

### Real-World Examples:
When this bucket is activated, it would include:
- 💰 **Bond payments** - Paying off debt from past capital projects
- 🏦 **Rainy day fund** - Building reserves for economic downturns
- 📉 **Revenue stabilization** - Cushion against revenue shortfalls
- 🎯 **Debt refinancing** - Restructuring bonds to save money

### Why It Matters:
Virginia's AAA bond rating (the highest possible) saves taxpayers millions in interest costs. Healthy reserves mean the state can weather recessions without drastic cuts to services.

### Future Development:
A TODO exists in the code to split Finance and Central Appropriations categories to populate this bucket with actual debt service and reserve contributions.

## 📊 How Story Buckets Work

### The Technical Foundation:
Virginia's budget uses **17 technical categories** based on how agencies are organized in state government. These categories are precise but not intuitive for citizens.

### The Story Bucket Layer:
Story buckets provide a **human-friendly translation** by grouping related categories into 9 narratives that answer the question: *"What is this money actually for?"*

### The Mapping:
- **17 technical categories** → **9 story buckets**
- **Same dollar amounts** (just regrouped for clarity)
- **Preserves accuracy** (all data comes from official LIS Member Request pages)
