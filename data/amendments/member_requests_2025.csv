change would utilize the same performance cycle, but, after a transition year, would shift from
making the value-based payment with a 7 to 10-month lag to an on-going, real-time payment
associated with when facilities submit claims. This would be accomplished as a VBP per day
amount, based on the same performance results, but which would be included in the rate paid
through the normal claims process in each rate year that immediately follows each performance
year. While the program is well-received and effective, the lump sum approach does not address
the fact that many of the initiatives undertaken to address quality concerns, such as staff
augmentation, are ongoing daily costs. As lump sums received long after the fact, day-to-day
operations are stressed to maintain the initiatives without the additional reimbursement as the
costs are incurred. Additionally, lenders are not willing to provide credit based on potential
future “bonuses” that are unknown in amounts, and budgeting is much more difficult given the
uncertainty of the retroactive lump sum VBP payment approach. For many providers using
accrual accounting principles, they also end up paying taxes on an “expected” amount of VBP
revenue before they have even received the revenue, further stressing their finances to maintain
the initiatives while awaiting the potential payout each year. Additionally, the lump sum
approach has caused additional administrative costs for the five Medicaid managed care
organizations (MCOs",,,,Amendment Member Requests/HB1600/HB1600 Member Requests.pdf,197,Sickles,2025-11-21T11:06:31.300198-05:00,
