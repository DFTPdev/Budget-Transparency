","<p class='hstextf'>(This amendment reduces nongeneral fund spending in the Medicaid program by almost $14.0 million in fiscal year 2025 and $18.1 million in fiscal year 2026 and adds language requiring the Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS) to contract with a single pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) to administer all pharmacy benefits for the Medicaid fee-for-service and Cardinal Care programs. Currently, DMAS delivers pharmacy benefits to Medicaid enrollees through the traditional Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) program and through Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) under the Cardinal Care managed care program. The high cost of drugs and low reimbursement rates are causing pharmacies to close.  A Virginia Commonwealth University study in 2023 demonstrated that pharmacy deserts were occurring throughout Virginia.  Community pharmacies serve an integral role in our communities, especially in rural and urban populations. Each MCO has their own PBM.  This amendment directs DMAS to directly contract with its own, transparent and fiduciary-based PBM.  Each MCO would then be required to contract with this PBM for, among other services, drug acquisition and dispensing. DMAS can reduce duplicative administrative costs, streamline management of the pharmacy benefit and allow transparency in drug costs and dispensing fees.  A 2019 General Assembly-directed study proved that DMAS would save at least $32 million with a direct PBM. In Kentucky, the General Assembly’s directive to direct-manage the pharmacy benefit in 2020 saved the state $283 million.  In Texas, a state commissioned study has shown that carving pharmacy benefits out of the Medicaid managed care program could save the state up to $90.3 million a year.)</p>",

Currently, DMAS delivers pharmacy benefits to Medicaid enrollees through the traditional Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) program and through Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) under the Cardinal Care managed care program. The high cost of drugs and low reimbursement rates are causing pharmacies to close.  A Virginia Commonwealth University study in 2023 demonstrated that pharmacy deserts were occurring throughout Virginia.  Community pharmacies serve an integral role in our communities, especially in rural and urban populations. Each MCO has their own PBM.  This amendment directs DMAS to directly contract with its own, transparent and fiduciary-based PBM.  Each MCO would then be required to contract with this PBM for, among other services, drug acquisition and dispensing. DMAS can reduce duplicative administrative costs, streamline management of the pharmacy benefit and allow transparency in drug costs and dispensing fees.  A 2019 General Assembly-directed study proved that DMAS would save at least $32 million with a direct PBM. In Kentucky, the General Assembly’s directive to direct-manage the pharmacy benefit in 2020 saved the state $283 million.  In Texas, a state commissioned study has shown that carving pharmacy benefits out of the Medicaid managed care program could save the state up to $90.3 million a year.)</p>",

At the time the Department of Medical Assistance Services was given the authority to impose two provider assessments on private acute care hospitals, (i) a coverage assessment intended to pay the state 10 percent share of the full cost of expanding Medicaid coverage pursuant to the Affordable Care Act and (ii) an assessment to enhance Medicaid payment rates for private acute care hospitals in the Commonwealth. This second hospital provider payment rate (tax) assessment was intended to satisfy the state share of costs to increase Medicaid fee-for services rates to the federal upper payment limit and close the managed care organization hospital payment gap for both inpatient and outpatient services. The provider tax assessment applies to the same group of hospitals as the coverage assessment and is administered in a similar manner. This amendment increases the number of hospitals subject to the tax assessment to all private hospitals in Virginia and excludes only public hospitals from the calculation of the tax assessment. Currently only 63 hospitals are subject to the provider tax assessment. This amendment would expand that number to cover 80 hospitals.)</p>",

","<p class='hstextf'>(This amendment modifies language related to the nursing facility value-based payments. This change would utilize the same performance cycle, but, after a transition year, would shift from making the value-based payment with a 7 to 10-month lag to an on-going, real-time payment associated with when facilities submit claims. This would be accomplished as a VBP per day amount, based on the same performance results, but which would be included in the rate paid through the normal claims process in each rate year that immediately follows each performance year. While the program is well-received and effective, the lump sum approach does not address the fact that many of the initiatives undertaken to address quality concerns, such as staff augmentation, are ongoing daily costs. As lump sums received long after the fact, day-to-day operations are stressed to maintain the initiatives without the additional reimbursement as the costs are incurred. Additionally, lenders are not willing to provide credit based on potential future “bonuses” that are unknown in amounts, and budgeting is much more difficult given the uncertainty of the retroactive lump sum VBP payment approach. For many providers using accrual accounting principles, they also end up paying taxes on an “expected” amount of VBP revenue before they have even received the revenue, further stressing their finances to maintain the initiatives while awaiting the potential payout each year. Additionally, the lump sum approach has caused additional administrative costs for the five Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs), and likely for the fee-for-service contractor as well. The lump sums are administered as a separate payment process by each of the participating MCOs, and the costs of that undertaking are reflected in the costs of the per member per month payments made under the Cardinal Care contract. By switching to a claims-based approach, it simplifies the task for the MCOs as they are simply paying claims as they are submitted, with VBP being a virtually invisible part of that as far as the MCO process is concerned.)</p>",
