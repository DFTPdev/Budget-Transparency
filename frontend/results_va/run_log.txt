Starting VA Budget Pipeline Analysis - Tue Sep  2 16:25:19 EDT 2025
Step 1: Analyzing data files
Step 2: Calculating fund-year sums and reconciliation
Step 3: Creating reconciliation analysis
Step 4: ETL Analysis

=== FINAL ANALYSIS SUMMARY ===
Root Cause: Pipeline processes only LIS amendments (~$10B), missing base budget (~$170B)
Scale Factor Needed: 17.28x
Primary Fix: Integrate DPB base budget data into district totals
Secondary Fixes: Biennial calculation, fund classification
Risk Level: Low (additive changes)
Next Steps: Integrate base appropriations data sources

=== COMMANDS RUN ===
1. find . -name "*budget*" -type d
2. find . -name "*.csv" -o -name "*.parquet" -o -name "*.json" | grep -v node_modules
3. mkdir -p results_va
4. node -e "..." (Project manifest analysis)
5. node -e "..." (Fund-year sums calculation)
6. node -e "..." (Reconciliation analysis)
7. ETL script analysis via codebase-retrieval
8. Created fix_patch.diff and pr_description.md

=== KEY FINDINGS ===
- Current data: $10.49B (amendments only)
- Target data: $181.2B (full biennial budget)
- Missing: $170.71B (94% of total budget)
- DPB General Fund available: $34.9B (not integrated)
- Root cause: Missing base budget appropriations
- Solution: Integrate DPB data + add base budget sources
