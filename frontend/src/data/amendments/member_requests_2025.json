    "descriptionFull": "This amendment provides $1.7 million from the general fund and $9.5 million from nongeneral\nfunds the second year to provide Medicaid supplemental payments to Sheltering Arms\nRehabilitation Center. Sheltering Arms treats one out of every four Medicaid patients in\nVirginia in need of inpatient rehabilitation services. The services provided treat the most acute\ninjuries to this population, including stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury. As a\nresult, SAI has the highest cost of services compared to other rehabilitation hospitals in\nVirginia. Because DMAS calculates its rates using a pool containing all rehabilitation hospitals,\nSheltering Arms effective reimbursement is comparatively lower than other rehabilitation\nhospitals. For fiscal year 2025, Sheltering Arms will be reimbursed at a level less than 69\npercent of cost of providing inpatient services to Medicaid patients. Other inpatient\nrehabilitation providers are reimbursed at a level closer to 80 percent of cost. This proposal was\nincluded in the agency's fall 2024 budget submissions.",

    "descriptionFull": "This amendment modifies language related to the nursing facility value-based payments. This\nchange would utilize the same performance cycle, but, after a transition year, would shift from\nmaking the value-based payment with a 7 to 10-month lag to an on-going, real-time payment\nassociated with when facilities submit claims. This would be accomplished as a VBP per day\namount, based on the same performance results, but which would be included in the rate paid\nthrough the normal claims process in each rate year that immediately follows each performance\nyear. While the program is well-received and effective, the lump sum approach does not address\nthe fact that many of the initiatives undertaken to address quality concerns, such as staff\naugmentation, are ongoing daily costs. As lump sums received long after the fact, day-to-day\noperations are stressed to maintain the initiatives without the additional reimbursement as the\ncosts are incurred. Additionally, lenders are not willing to provide credit based on potential\nfuture “bonuses” that are unknown in amounts, and budgeting is much more difficult given the\nuncertainty of the retroactive lump sum VBP payment approach. For many providers using\naccrual accounting principles, they also end up paying taxes on an “expected” amount of VBP\nrevenue before they have even received the revenue, further stressing their finances to maintain\nthe initiatives while awaiting the potential payout each year. Additionally, the lump sum\napproach has caused additional administrative costs for the five Medicaid managed care\norganizations (MCOs",

According to the Office of the Executive Secretary,\ncurrent Criminal Fund balances are projected to cover the costs in FY 2026, but the ongoing\nannual Criminal Fund appropriation would need to increase by approximately $4.0 million to\naccommodate the rate change beginning in FY 2027.
