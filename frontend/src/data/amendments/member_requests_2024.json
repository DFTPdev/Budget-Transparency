JLARC notes that the state includes funding for less than 3,000\ninstructional assistants, while school divisions employ approximately 21,000. This amount is\nhigher than estimates provided in a prior year due to the large increase in the number of schools\naccredited with conditions. This is an estimate. The actual fiscal impact is to be determined.",
